Zero-dependency React component for progressively loading your images with as much responsiveness as you need. All the power is given to you for extending or wrapping to meet your use case. Serviced by a render prop for excellent integration with all your projects.

## The problem

You don't want to load huge images for mobile users but mapping everything in image srcset
is verbose. You also want to be able to track the loading state of the image so that you
can apply styles for a smooth user interface.

## This solution

This is a component that handles all the `srcset` and responsive image setup for you while keeping track of `loading` state so that you can worry about making the rest of your page load fast. It uses a [render prop](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/use-a-render-prop-50de598f11ce) which gives you maximum flexibility with a minimal API because you are responsible for the rendering of everything and you simply apply props to what you're rendering. Use this component together with your own taste in styles to acheive effects like [Medium's Blur Effect](https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/). The implementation is up to you! The heavy lifting (not so heavy actually...) is up to us.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/) and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save react-power-picture
```

> This package also depends on `react` and `prop-types`. Please make sure you
> have those installed as well.

## Usage

[![Edit v06l97zxyy](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/v06l97zxyy)

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import PowerPicture from 'react-power-picture';

const sources = [
  {
    size: 400,
    src: 'https://source.unsplash.com/random/200x140'
  },
  {
    size: 800,
    src: 'https://source.unsplash.com/random/300x200'
  },
  {
    size: 1200,
    src: 'https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x300'
  }
];

render(
  <PowerPicture sources={sources}>
    {(image, loading) => (
      <div>
        <p>Loading state: {loading.toString()}</p>
        <img alt="A p!cture is worth a thousand words" src={image} />
      </div>
    )}
  </PowerPicture>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

<PowerPicture /> is the only component. It doesn't render anything itself, it just calls the render function and renders that. Use this to create anything you'd like to!

## Props

<!-- This table was generated via http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables -->

| prop      | type     | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sources` | array    | An array of objects, each one with a `size` and `src` key, value pair. React Power Picture uses this source map and the windows width to determine the optimal image to load given the number of object that the prop provides. |
| `source`  | string   | A url string for an image. Use this prop if you only have one image size for all device sizes.                                                                                                                                  |
| `onError` | function | Optional callback method that is triggered if there is an error loading the image.                                                                                                                                              |

## Examples

A live example of this in action can be found on the [project's GitHub page](https://tvthatsme.github.io/react-power-picture).

## Inspiration

This project has been heavily inspired by the work of Formidable Labs and their [react-progressive-image](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-progressive-image) library. It does many things exactly right but did not provide the responsive solution (`srcset`) that I was originally looking for.

Another shoutout to the [react-simple-image](https://github.com/bitjourney/react-simple-image) library. This project has everything for responsive images loaded as a `srcset` but with much broader prop support and less render flexibiliy.

You might consider React Power Picture to be a marriage of the two. My goal for this library to provide both progressive and responsive power.

## Other solutions

There are many other React image-related components that you might want to consider before choosing `react-power-picture`. They all have different use cases, and many of them make opinionated choices in dependencies and/or peer-dependencies. This library will always take the approach of simplicity and flexibility over extended functionality. Do one thing and do it well. If you want to wrap or extend `react-power-picture` with extra functionality such as network speed detection, element in view, or other features, please extend this work or take a look at the following similar solutions.
